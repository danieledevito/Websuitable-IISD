            <p>The Sustainable Infrastructure Portal is a repository of news and views on sustainable infrastructure. It
                helps governments, citizens and financiers address the challenges in closing the USD 90 trillion global
                infrastructure gap and to position infrastructure as the catalyst for realising the Sustainable
                Development Goals.</p>

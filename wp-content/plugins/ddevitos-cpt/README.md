## Custom Post Type Plugin

### How To Use

Custom post types and taxonomies are created as per the main configuration file found in /config/main-config.php.

The main-config.php file returns an array with all cpt and taxonomy arguments required for registration.
 
You should update this file before activating the plugin.
